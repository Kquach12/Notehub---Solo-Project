#Description:

Inspired by learning through Zoom, I was thinking of building a note-taking application that has a stopwatch and records timestamps of when each note is taken. 
That way, you know what time of the recording to refer to when you go through your notes. 

There will also be an explore feature, so you'll be able to make your notes public and other users can view your notes and favorite them. 
Your classmates who missed class, or anyone really, can use your public notes to catch up, compare notes, or pick your brain on different chapters. 


#Feature List:

Minamal Viable Project:
 - Login/Registration 
 - CRUD notes
 - Many-to-Many Relationships (favoriting other notes)
 
 

Nice to have:
 - Upload zoom recordings and use time stamps on notes to skip to that time on the recording.
 - AJAX (update note taking page asynchronously)
 - JS Stopwatch
